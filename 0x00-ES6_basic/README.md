#0x00. ES6 Basics
ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth major version of the ECMAScript standard. It is a scripting language specification that forms the basis of JavaScript. ES6 introduced numerous new features and enhancements to JavaScript, bringing significant improvements to the language.
Some of the key features introduced in ES6 include:
##Block-scoped Variables:
ES6 introduced the let and const keywords for declaring variables. Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are limited to the block in which they are defined (e.g., within a loop or conditional statement). Variables declared with const are also block-scoped, but they cannot be reassigned once they are defined.

##Arrow Functions:
Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions. They are defined using the => syntax and have a lexically bound this value, meaning they inherit the this value from the enclosing context. Arrow functions are often used for writing shorter and more readable code.

##Default Function Parameters:
ES6 allows providing default values for function parameters. If a function is called with missing arguments, the default values will be used instead. This feature eliminates the need for explicit parameter checks and simplifies function declarations.

##Rest and Spread Function Parameters:
Rest parameters are denoted by the ellipsis (...) and allow a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. Spread syntax (also using ...) allows an array to be expanded into individual elements when passed as function arguments or used in array literals.

##String Templating:
ES6 introduced template literals, which allow embedding expressions and variables inside strings using backticks (`). Template literals support multiline strings and make string interpolation more convenient by using placeholders (${expression}) to insert values dynamically.

##Enhanced Object Literals:
ES6 enhanced object literals by providing shorthand syntax for defining methods and properties. Objects can be created using concise syntax, and computed property names allow using expressions for defining property keys.

##Iterators and for-of Loops:  
ES6 introduced the concept of iterators, which are objects that define a sequence and provide a way to access its elements one by one. The for-of loop allows iterating over iterable objects, such as arrays and strings, in a concise and readable manner.
